# Raspberry Pi Pico WH IoT Weather Station

 For this project I used a Raspberry Pi Pico WH microcontroller connected to a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor and a set of LEDs to create a simple weather station that sends data wirelessly to Adafruit IO, a cloud platform for IoT data visualization and logging. The reason for me to choose this as my project was the means of convenience, but otherwise I found interesting to have the idea thaat this microcontroller (which a variant was used for another course) is able to read and send data to the cloud as an IoT object!

_Estimated project completion time: 4h_

## Project Overview

- The **DHT11 sensor** measures temperature and humidity.
- The **Pico WH** connects to a Wi-Fi network to send sensor readings to Adafruit IO.
- The device uses **LED animations** to indicate status (e.g., loading or activity).
- The code is organized into separate modules for better maintainability, including Wi-Fi connection, sensor reading, LED control, and Adafruit IO communication.
- Sensor data is sent regularly (every 10 seconds) to specific feeds on Adafruit IO, allowing remote monitoring of the environmental conditions.

## Project Choice and Purpose

I chose this project to **learn about IoT (Internet of Things)** in a hands-on way. It's a great simple project to see how devices connect to the internet.

---

### Why I Picked This Project

I wanted a clear way to see how **IoT works**. The Raspberry Pi Pico WH has **built-in Wi-Fi**, which made it easy to send data without extra parts. It was perfect for learning about sensors, coding, and sending information online.

---

### What It Does

This device is a **mini weather station**. Its main job is to **watch the temperature and humidity** in a room.

* **Remote Monitoring:** Since it sends data to Adafruit IO, I can **check the weather conditions** from anywhere on my phone or computer.
* **IoT Example:** It shows how a physical sensor collects data, how a small computer (the Pico) sends it, and how a website (Adafruit IO) shows it. It's a clear **IoT demonstration**.
* **Future Ideas:** It's also a starting point for bigger projects. I can add more sensors or make it do more things later.

---

### What I'll Learn From the Data

By seeing the temperature and humidity change over time on Adafruit IO, I expect to learn a few things:

* **How stable my environment is:** I'll see if the temperature and humidity stay steady or jump around a lot. This can show if a room is well-insulated or has drafts.
* **Daily patterns:** I can spot when the room gets warmest or coldest, or when humidity changes, like after a shower or cooking.
* **What affects it:** I'll see how opening a window or turning on the heat changes the readings. This helps me understand my space better.

## Hardware Components

This project utilizes the following hardware components:

* **Raspberry Pi Pico WH:** A compact microcontroller serving as the central processing unit. Its integrated Wi-Fi module enables wireless network connectivity for data transmission.
* **DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor:** An environmental sensor responsible for acquiring digital readings of ambient temperature and relative humidity.
* **3 LEDs (with Resistors):** Light-emitting diodes used in conjunction with current-limiting resistors to provide visual status indications during operation.
* **Breadboard and Jumper Wires:** Prototyping tools used for solderless interconnection of electronic components and establishing electrical pathways within the circuit.
* **USB Cable:** Provides power to the Raspberry Pi Pico WH and facilitates firmware programming and serial communication.

I bought these components through the starter kit offered for the IoT course which costs 349SEK: [Electrokit](https://www.electrokit.com/lnu-starter)

## How It Works

1. On startup, the Pico connects to the specified Wi-Fi network using credentials stored securely in a separate file.
2. The DHT11 sensor is read to gather current temperature and humidity data.
3. LEDs run a simple loading animation while sensor readings and data transmission occur.
4. Sensor data is posted to Adafruit IO feeds via HTTP requests using the Picoâ€™s Wi-Fi connection.
5. This cycle repeats indefinitely, updating the cloud dashboard regularly.

## Computer Setup

Setting up my computer environment is important for programming the Raspberry Pi Pico WH. I utilized **Thonny IDE** as i found it easier to code with for the pico and it feels more user-friendly with the interface and integrated MicroPython support.

---

### Chosen IDE

I selected **Thonny** as my integrated development environment (IDE). Thonny is a Python IDE specifically designed to be accessible for beginners, and it includes built-in functionalities for direct interaction with MicroPython devices, making it an ideal choice for the Raspberry Pi Pico. You can download Thonny from their official website: [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/).

---

## Platform Choice

I chose **Adafruit IO** as my IoT cloud platform for this project. Its primary functionality is to provide a user-friendly way to visualize and log data sent from IoT devices like my Raspberry Pi Pico WH. Adafruit IO is a **cloud-based platform**, meaning my data is stored and managed online, allowing me to monitor my weather station remotely from any internet-connected device. For this project, I am using its **free subscription tier**, which offers enough capacity for my current needs. If I wanted to scale my idea in the future, Adafruit IO provides options for increased data limits and features, or I could explore other cloud IoT platforms like Google Cloud IoT Core or AWS IoT, which offer more extensive services for larger-scale deployments.

### Code Upload Workflow

The process of deploying code (flashing) to the Raspberry Pi Pico WH involves two main stages:

1.  **Flashing MicroPython Firmware:** The Raspberry Pi Pico must first be equipped with the MicroPython firmware. This procedure involves:
    * **Downloading** the appropriate `.uf2` firmware file for the Raspberry Pi Pico WH from the official MicroPython downloads page.
    * **Connecting** the Pico to the computer while simultaneously pressing and holding the `BOOTSEL` button. This action causes the Pico to appear as a removable mass storage device (similar to a USB flash drive).
    * **Dragging and dropping** the downloaded `.uf2` firmware file directly onto the mounted Pico drive. The Pico will automatically reboot once the firmware transfer is complete, now operating with MicroPython.

2.  **Uploading Application Code:** After the MicroPython firmware is installed, my project's Python scripts (e.g., `main.py`, `leds.py`, `wifi_connect.py`, `adafruit_io.py`, `secrets.py`) are uploaded directly using Thonny:
    * Within Thonny, I configure the interpreter to recognize the Raspberry Pi Pico, typically by selecting the appropriate serial port.
    * I can then use Thonny's built-in functionalities to **save my Python files directly to the Pico's file system**. The primary script, `main.py`, is configured to execute automatically upon the Pico's boot-up.

---

### Required Computer Setup Steps

The computer setup was significantly simplified by using Thonny:

* **Thonny Installation:** The primary requirement was the installation of **Thonny IDE**. Thonny is designed as a cross-platform application and typically bundles all necessary components, such as integrated Python interpreters and serial port drivers, for seamless communication with MicroPython boards. This design **eliminates the need for separate installations of additional software like Node.js, specific device drivers, or complex command-line toolchains.**

### The circuit pinout

![Circuit Layout of Raspberry Pi Pico Weather Station](circuit.png)

I've assembled my circuit on a breadboard, connecting the Raspberry Pi Pico WH, the DHT11 sensor, and the three LEDs with their respective resistors. Essentially, the lights are unnecessary for a project like this, but I did want to add some sort of visual indicator that the sensor is reading and sending data to Adafruit.
- DHT11 Sensor:
  - VCC (grey wire): I connected this to a 3.3V power pin on the Raspberry Pi Pico WH.
  - Data (white wire): This is connected to GPIO pin GP28 on the Pico for reading sensor data.
  - GND (black wire): I connected this to a Ground (GND) pin on the Pico.

- LEDs (Green, Yellow, Red):
  - Each LED's anode (longer leg) is connected to a specific GPIO pin on the Pico via a resistor. I've connected the Red LED to GP2, the Yellow LED to GP3, and the Green LED to GP4. The resistors are crucial to limit current and protect the LEDs.
  - Each LED's cathode (shorter leg) is connected to the common ground rail on the breadboard.

- Raspberry Pi Pico WH:
  - I'm powering it via its USB connection.
  - The GND pin (black wire) is connected to the common ground rail on the breadboard.

## Understanding My Data Flow: From Sensor to Cloud

My IoT weather station's core function is to continuously monitor environmental conditions and transmit that data online to show the essence of **Internet of Things (IoT)**, where physical objects (the sensor and Pico) connect and communicate over the internet.

---

### 1. Sensor Data Acquisition

The journey begins with my **DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor**, which is physically connected to my Raspberry Pi Pico WH. My MicroPython code, specifically the `dht_sensor.measure()` command, instructs the sensor to actively read the current ambient temperature and relative humidity. The DHT11 then digitizes these environmental measurements and sends them to the Pico's designated GPIO pin.
```python
import time
import dht
from machine import Pin
import wifi_connect
import adafruit_io
import leds

# Setup sensor
dht_sensor = dht.DHT11(Pin(28))

# Connect to WiFi
wifi_connect.connect_wifi()

while True:
    leds.loading_animation()

    try:
        dht_sensor.measure()
        temp = dht_sensor.temperature()
        hum = dht_sensor.humidity()

        print(f"Temperature: {temp}Â°C, Humidity: {hum}%")

        # Send to Adafruit IO
        adafruit_io.send_data("temperature", temp)
        adafruit_io.send_data("humidity", hum)

    except Exception as e:
        print("Error reading sensor:", e)

    leds.all_off()
    time.sleep(10)  # wait before next reading

```

---

### 2. Pico Processing and Preparation

Once the Pico receives the raw digital signals from the DHT11, the script processes these into usable temperature (in Celsius) and humidity (as a percentage) values. I chose display these values in the console (debugging) for real-time verification. During this data acquisition phase, I added a custom **LED loading animation** that provides visual feedback, indicating that the device is actively working.
```python
from machine import Pin
import time

led_pins = [Pin(2, Pin.OUT), Pin(3, Pin.OUT), Pin(4, Pin.OUT)]

def loading_animation():
    for _ in range(2):  # repeat twice
        for led in led_pins:
            led.on()
            time.sleep(0.2)
            led.off()
    time.sleep(0.5)

def all_off():
    for led in led_pins:
        led.off()

```

---

### 3. Establishing Wi-Fi Connectivity

This step is to fulfill the "Internet" aspect of IoT. My Raspberry Pi Pico WH utilizes its **built-in Wi-Fi module** to connect to my local network. The `wifi_connect.connect_wifi()` function manages this process, securely using credentials (like SSID and password) stored separately from the main script. A rgood Wi-Fi connection is essential for enabling any remote data transmission. I have in my own machine a class called "secrets.py", but this class is not submitted in this repository as it has my private credentials for my Adafruit account and my WiFi credentials. However, this is how the WiFi connection is created:

```python
import network
import time
import secrets

def connect_wifi():
    wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
    wlan.active(True)
    wlan.connect(secrets.WIFI_SSID, secrets.WIFI_PASSWORD)

    print("Connecting to WiFi...", end="")
    while not wlan.isconnected():
        print(".", end="")
        time.sleep(0.5)
    print("\nConnected! IP:", wlan.ifconfig()[0])

```

---

### 4. Transmitting Data to Adafruit IO Cloud

With a stable Wi-Fi connection, the Pico can now communicate with **Adafruit IO**, my chosen **cloud platform** for IoT data. The lines `adafruit_io.send_data("temperature", temp)` and `adafruit_io.send_data("humidity", hum)` orchestrate this transmission. These functions are essentially initiating **HTTP POST requests** to Adafruit IO's servers. Each request contains:

* My **Adafruit IO username and API key** for authentication.
* The specific **feed name** (e.g., "temperature" or "humidity") to direct the data to the correct storage location.
* The actual **sensor reading** (e.g., `23.0` for temperature or `50.5` for humidity).

Here you can see how the data is sent to Adafruit in code:
```python
import urequests
import secrets

BASE_URL = "https://io.adafruit.com/api/v2/{}/feeds/{}/data"

def send_data(feed_name, value):
    url = BASE_URL.format(secrets.ADAFRUIT_IO_USERNAME, feed_name)
    headers = {"X-AIO-Key": secrets.ADAFRUIT_IO_KEY, "Content-Type": "application/json"}
    data = '{"value": ' + str(value) + '}'

    try:
        response = urequests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data)
        response.close()
        print(f"Sent {value} to {feed_name}")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error sending data:", e)

```

---

### 5. Cloud-Based Data Logging and Visualization

Upon receiving the data, Adafruit IO performs two key functions:

* **Data Logging:** Every single data point sent from the Pico is timestamped and permanently stored. This builds a valuable **historical record** of environmental conditions.
* **Visualization:** Adafruit IO automatically generates **dynamic, real-time graphs** for each feed. These visualizations allow me to remotely monitor trends, analyze patterns, and observe immediate changes in temperature and humidity from any web browser or mobile device, showing the remote monitoring capability of IoT.

# Presenting the data
  
## Temperature

The data was received in my feeds, the temperature feed showed as following:
![Temperature received](Temperature_2.0.png)
The temperature was constant 23 degrees Cecius, as I did not do a long reading of the temperature in my room. I assume if I were to do a reading of 12 hours there would not be much variety in the temperature, maybe about 2 or 3 degrees difference.

## Humidity

The humidity received was:
![Humidity feed](Humidity_2.0.png)
Humidity variated a little bit, since a bit after I started the reading I opened one of my apartment windows, perhaps explaining the drop.

This entire cycle repeats continuously, every 10 seconds, forming a seamless and automated data pipeline from the physical world to my digital dashboard. It's a clear demonstration of a practical IoT solution!

## View of the project

This project did not mean a lot of difficulty, I already had experience programming with microcontrollers from a previous course, so at least the circuit wiring was an easy part to write. Using Thonny was a big advantage and time saver, plus Adafruit makes it so easy to visualise the data without any complications.

Finally I would like to include a picture of how the circuit looks in real life!
